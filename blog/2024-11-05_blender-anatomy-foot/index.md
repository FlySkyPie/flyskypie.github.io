## 距骨 (Talus)

足部遊上而下往下數的第一塊骨頭，連接小腿與腳掌。

## 足舟骨 (Navicular Bone)

這塊骨頭因為跟距骨 (Talus) 接觸的地方有一個凹陷，形狀乍看有點像個小船：

> "boat-shaped," early 15c., in reference to the navicular bone of the foot, from Late Latin navicularis "pertaining to a boat," from navicula, diminutive of navis "ship" (from PIE root *nau- "boat"). The classical sense of "relating to small ships or boats" (1650s) is rare in English.[^boat-shaped]

從前方往後看，有三根骨頭像[楔子](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/楔子)插入一般，它們是楔形骨 (Cuneiform)。
